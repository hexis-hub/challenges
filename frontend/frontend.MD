## Front-End Challenge

**Goal:**  
Develop a client side application to get the most popular repositories of a user (by popularity). This application must be Crossbrowser

**API**: [https://developer.github.com/v3/](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

### **Goals to achieve** ###
Like a regular user we want to: 
* Search an GitHub user;
* See the searched GitHub user details and repos;
* Sort the results by order (DESC; ASC) and popularity;
* See the details of a repo;

### **How I know that I've done?** ###

* You should have at least one screen with a searchbox to type an user;
* The search must return a detail page (Navigation and UX is by your own ;))
* I can navigate between repositories and change users;
* The layout is responsive and fits well even in mobile. (starting in a 320x480px minimum resolution);

** Frameworks and libs aren't pre requisites but we use React, [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/);
DETAIL: Feel free to develop in other options like [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) 
or nothing, your choice, give us your best :);
* A routing system is extremaly requested;

### **Avaliation** ###

* Project organization (Folder, Architecture and project structure, documentation and versioning);
* Innovative ideas. We inspire creativity, the use of recent technologies and new patterns, get solid arguments 
and lets talk!
* Good practices (Security, organization and consistence for large scale applications);
* Well wrote and stable code;

PLUS: Automated and/or integration tests

The perfomance, resources utilization and network handling will be avaliated during the entire process.

### **Complementation** ###
API Reference:
* User details: [https://api.github.com/users/{username}](https://api.github.com/users/{username})
* User repositories: [https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos](https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos)
* Repository details: [https://api.github.com/repos/{full_name}](https://api.github.com/repos/{full_name})
